  <p>Ealaiontoir School of Irish Arts, Inc. is a registered non-profit charity and is solely funded by your generosity.
  </p>
  <p>All initial funds raised will be dedicated to securing and renovating an appropriate location, with any further
    support going directly towards reducing costs of community programs (such as by providing loaner equipment,
    offsetting membership cost, and future scholarships). We wish to make it abundantly clear that NO funds from this
    campaign will be utilized as payment for instruction or administration, and will be used only for the above
    described purposes.</p>
  <p>Please consider donating to continue the preservation of Irish culture and heritage!</p>
